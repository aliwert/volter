//! Built-in middleware for volter, expressed as `tower::Layer`s.
//!
//! Anything here composes with any other `tower`/`tower-http` layer — see
//! `ARCHITECTURE.md` → "Middleware model".
//!
//! Implemented:
//!
//! - [`TraceLayer`] — per-request tracing spans (method, path, status,
//!   latency).
//!
//! Planned:
//!
//! - `TimeoutLayer` — per-request timeout, returning a proper HTTP
//!   response (not a dropped connection) on expiry.
//! - `CorsLayer` — thin, opinionated wrapper over `tower_http::cors`.
//! - `RequestBodyLimitLayer` — reject oversized bodies before they're fully
//!   buffered.
//! - `CatchPanicLayer` — converts a panic that slips through handler code
//!   into a 500 response and a `tracing::error!` log line. This is a
//!   safety net, not a substitute for `RULES.md` #1 — panics should not be
//!   reachable from user input in the first place.
//!
//! TODO(v0.1): `TimeoutLayer`, `CatchPanicLayer`.
//! TODO(v0.3): rate limiting, connection limits (see `PROJECT.md`
//! milestones).
